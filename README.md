# Wrodle-Reload
The objective of this game is to guess the randomly selected
    word within a given number of attempts. You can select either
    a three or five word board.
    At the conclusion of the game, stats will be displayed.
    Indicators will be given if characters of the user entered
    word are reflected in the guessed word.
        - If the character is in the correct position, the character
          will display as an uppercase value.
        - If the character is within the random word, the character
          will display as a lowercase value.
        - If you enter a character that is not in the word, an asterisk '*'
          will display.
